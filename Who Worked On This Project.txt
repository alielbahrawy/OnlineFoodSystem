"Akalni Shokran - Online Order System" project:

We, a team of five AI Faculty students, are thrilled to present "Akalni Shokran" (Arabic for "Ãßáäí ÔßÑðÇ"),
an online ordering system developed from scratch using C++ and OOP fundamentals. 
This project served as our practical exam, showcasing our understanding of these core concepts.

Our team consisted of:

    Leader->Mohamed Ashraf: Implemented the Customer class and integrated all system components within the main program.

    Ali Fathy Ali (Ali Elbahrawy): Implemented the Delivery and Feedback classes.
   
    Anas Mohamed EL-Gezawy: Implemented the Owner class functionalities and assisted Mohamed in specific areas.

    Eman Mohamed Hekal: Implemented the restaurant menu class, enabling menu storage in a file, and developed the order creation functionality.

    Abdelrahman Tamer: Implemented the Payment class and linked it to the Customer class for seamless transactions.

While this project spanned a week across separate days due to our academic schedules,
 the collaborative effort and dedication of each member were instrumental in its successful completion. 
We believe "Akalni Shokran" has the potential to streamline the online ordering experience for both restaurants and customers.
